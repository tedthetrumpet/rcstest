# Appendices

:::note
There is an argument to say that if information is important enough to be in the handbook, then it should not be in an appendix! However, this has proved a useful section to have in the PG Music handbooks, particularly for stand-alone polices such as the 'SoM Performance Opportunities and Commitments Policy' and the 'Change of Teacher' policy.

:::note
Appendices in the nature of stand-alone policies could be linked to as .pdf files or authored as part of the site: see examples in 'Draft MMus-MA Handbook 2025-26'.
