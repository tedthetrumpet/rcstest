# Learning and teaching

:::note
The current guidance note states 'please refer to the RCS Learning and Teaching Strategy, outlining the ways in which your Programmes aligns with the vision, mission and values' and quotes a section of the Strategy 2030.

It seems to me that this is already covered under [Programme specification – Curriculum principles](programme_specification#curriculum-principles) and [Programme specification – Graduate attributes](programme_specification#graduate-attributes).

Demonstrating 'alignment' should be under [Programme specification – Benchmarks ](programme_specification#benchmarks).

I suggest this section be used instead as a student-facing outline of teaching and learning on the programme: for instance, a description of the various modules and how they are delivered.
