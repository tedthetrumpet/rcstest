# Programme specification

:::note
The 'programme specification' is central to what the QAA term the 'definitive course document' that constitutes 'the approved definition of a course […], which should contain sufficient information for stakeholders about intended aims and learning outcomes and about the approach to teaching, learning and assessment'.

Much of the information in this section is formally necessary, and mainly of use at validation and to registry. While it can still be made student facing, this long page is purposely kept seperate from the rest of the handbook as being perhaps of less direct interest to students than other sections.

## Summary details

:::note
I've left the headings below as they are in the current template, but it seems to me possible that the programme title/s, duration/s, mode/s of study and credit framework might be conveyed in a more compact way, perhaps as a single table? Or as a narrative?

## Curriculum principles

:::note
Heading 4 used here and elsewhere for prefaratory statements followed by colons, so that they do not appear in the online page navigation.

:::note
For example: The language of study is English. Applicants whose first language is not English will be required to provide evidence of proficiency in English.

## Programme structure

:::note
Depending on the programme, this section may need to be more complex. For example, see [MMus/MA draft handbook](https://handbooks.rcs.ac.uk/mmusma2425/handbook/programme_specification#programme-structure). Also, retitled this as programme _structure_ rather than _content_. I would suggest that the _content_ of the programme be outlined under 'Learning and teaching' and formally specified to an appropriate level of detail in the module descriptors.

| Module | Level | Credits | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Module title | 11 | 80 | Core |
| Module title | 11 | 20 | Core |
| Module title | 11 | 10 | Core |
| Module title | 7-11 | 10 | Elective |
| Total | | 120 |  |

## Benchmarks

:::warning
This section needs be revisited. Currently, the handbook only requires us to state the programme has been mapped to the relevant standards, not show the mappings themselves.
:::

:::note
To do: provide examples of mappings to eg SCQF, UK Quality code, ESG etc – possibly as links to .pdf files, as these are likely to be large complex tables :)
