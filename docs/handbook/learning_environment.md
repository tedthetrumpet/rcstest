## Health and safety

### Safe Space Statement
The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is fully committed to creating an environment where all staff and students treat each other fairly and with mutual respect, and to providing an environment where all students and staff are free from discrimination and intimidation.

The following **Safe Space Statement** applies to all activity happening within the Conservatoire, from early years classes to our Masters programmes.

> Everyone working and learning together in this room is entitled to do so in a safe space: a space free of bullying and harassment of any kind. We will honour our differences and collaborate in the true spirit of ensemble, promoting creative challenge whilst retaining the utmost respect for each other. We will treat one another with courtesy and respect at all times, and if we are subjected to or witness bullying or harassment we will speak out knowing that our voices will be heard and we will be taken seriously. We will actively promote a positive, optimistic and mutually supportive approach to work and study. Together we can create a Safe Space.

:::note
Guidance note: Details Related to Health, Safety and Wellbeing can be found on the Portal at https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/health-safety/

## Equality, diversity and inclusion

We welcome a diverse population of staff and students. Further, we are committed to promoting equality in all of our activities and we aim to provide a performing, learning, teaching, working and research environment free from unlawful discrimination against applicants, staff and students on the grounds of gender (actual or perceived), sexual orientation, disability, race, colour, nationality, national or ethnic origin, marital status, age and actual or perceived religious or similar belief.

The Conservatoire fosters a learning, teaching, research and working culture which not only supports diversity, inclusion and equity but indeed requires those principles. We are thoroughly committed to the promotion of equal opportunities across all of our functions and practices including those of learning and teaching, employment, representation, decision making, and procurement and partnerships.

The Conservatoire is committed to ensuring that those from all backgrounds feel able to apply to study with us. Applicants who have been looked after at home, in residential care, foster care or kinship care can access support via the International and Student Experience team at [welfare@rcs.ac.uk](mailto:welfare@rcs.ac.uk). Provisions are also made for Estranged Students and Student Carers.

:::note
Guidance note: Details can be found on the [Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Portal Page](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/equality-diversity-inclusion-edi/). Demonstrate how your programme meets the criteria as set above.

## Learning resources


## Staff

:::note
Current guidance note: details of Staff Development Resources can be found on the Portal.

Comment: why would staff development resources be included in a student handbook?
:::


## Copyright

:::note
Guidance note: No further information is required to be entered here in addition to the text below.
:::

The Regulations, Codes of Procedure and General Rules (Section F4) state:

> It is the responsibility of all staff and students of the Conservatoire to ensure that they comply with the provisions of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (‘the Act’). Breach of copyright regulations is a criminal offence and may expose both the individual and the Conservatoire to prosecution.
> 
> In simple terms, copyright in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work exists during the author’s lifetime and for a period of 70 years from the end of the calendar year in which the author dies. During this period, a work may not be copied without the permission of the rights or licence holder. Publishers, editors, artists, photographers and arrangers also have rights over a work. Advice on copyright issues is available from the Head of Information Services and all policies and guidelines are available on the Portal Copyright pages.

:::warning
There actually seem to be _two_ relevant pages on the portal, - [Copyright](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/library/copyright) and [portal.rcs.ac.uk/copyright](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/copyright/). Are these both current?
:::

## The student contract

:::note
At some point we should tackle the fact that we now have _two_ things called 'Student Contract' – the one that students sign at matriculation, and the online view of student records.

## Working week


## [Independent study, autonomous learner, reflective practitioner]

:::note
Comment: it's very odd that such fundamental matters – particularly for masters programmes! – are relegated to this distant subheading. Should these points not be addressed much earlier in the document? I have suggested that these might be addressed in the [Introduction](handbook#your-responsibilities)
:::


## Calendar

:::note
This is not a section in the current handbook, but perhaps could be? The table below is a (slightly clunky) version of the School of Music 'Shape of the Year' document. As with the assessment calendar in the programme specification, this might be more usefully replaced by a link to a shared Outlook calender? See for example [https://handbooks.rcs.ac.uk/mmusma2425/handbook/learning_environment#calendar](https://handbooks.rcs.ac.uk/mmusma2425/handbook/learning_environment#calendar)
