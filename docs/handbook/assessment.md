# Assessment

:::note
Comment: the current guidance states 'describe your approach to designing and implementing assessment in line with the Learning and Teaching Strategy'. This feels like the assessment from the perspective of *validation*: I wonder whether some of the more formal information here could be moved into the 'Programme specification' instead? Keep this section more student-facing?
:::

:::note
Perhaps there things missing from the template here. The Conservatoire Common Assessment Scale? Some guidance on plagiarisim and academic misconduct, signposted to the Rules & Regs? Graduation costs? I have included these below.
:::

### Assessment modes

:::note
Current guidance note: select from the indicative list below or augment with assessment modes specific to your programme. Remove the list of assessment modes from the final document.
:::


Modes of assessment:
* Self-Assessment Report/Reflective Journal
* Essay/Dissertation 
* Written Examination
* Assessed Recital/Performance/Exercise/Rehearsal
* Presentation
* Continuous Observation
* Portfolio
* Viva
* Pecha Kucha

| Module | Mode of assessment | Outcome |
| - | - | - |
| Principal Study | Performance | Graded |
| Supporting Studies | Observation of Working Practice | Pass/Fail |
| etc | Portfolio | Pass/Fail |

:::note
Reasonable use of a table here: see also below
:::

### Feedback

:::note
Current guidance note: please either select from the indicative list below or detail additional types of feedback relevant to your programme. Remove list of feedback modes from final document.
:::

Feedback Modes:

* Mutually constructed feedback
* Seminar
* Tutorial
* Written feedback
* Oral feedback
* Peer review
* Student contract 

:::note
Comment: this might be combined with the table above, eg:
:::

| Module | Mode of assessment | Outcome | Feedback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Principal Study | Performance | Graded | Written |
| Supporting Studies | Observation of Working Practice | Pass/Fail | Oral and Written |
| etc | Portfolio | Pass/Fail | Written |

:::note
Comment: in the MMus/MA handbook, this section is used to explain to students what we _mean_ by feedback, formative and summative, and give a narrative around the kinds of feedback used in different contexts. It is more nuanced than a bare list or table.
:::
 
### Assessment calendar


:::note
Comments: this very wide table – landscape format in Word – is not practical for online delivery, especially on mobile

An alternative approach would be to link to a shared Outlook calendar that outlines the timetabling of assessment for the programme in question, and/or highlight the student's Asimut calendar, which is where assessment deadlines ultimately appear.

#### Term 1

| Module | Credits | Assessment | Weighting or Pass/Fail | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | Options |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| title | 20 | Portfolio | P/F | P | P | P | P |  | S | A | G |  |  | F |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

A = Assessment; F = feedback; G = grading; P = process (time spent engaged in ongoing activities); S = week of submission; V = variable assessment week (assessment may take place at any time within the identified weeks).
 
### Progress and resit regulations

:::note
Detail any programme specific progress and resit regulations not already included in centralized RCS rules and regulations. Include link to the Rules & Regs.
:::

[Regulations, Codes of Procedure and General Rules](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/qualityassurance/rules-and-regulations/)


## Assessment scale

:::note
The Conservatoire Common Assessment Scale, suprisingly, does not appear in the current handbook template. The one given below is adapted for postgraduate use, not mentioning classifications. (Also, more work to be done on the layout of this table so as not to have to repeat the text 'Excellent' etc.)
:::

Assessment is recorded using the Conservatoire's Common Assessment Scale. The outcome of a module may either be noted as Pass/Fail, or graded alphanumerically:

| Common Assessment Scale | Descriptor |
| --- | --- |
| A1 | Excellent |
| A2 | Excellent |
| A3 | Excellent |
| A4 | Excellent |
| A5 | Excellent |
| B1 | Very Good |
| B2 | Very Good |
| B3 | Very Good |
| C1 | Good |
| C2 | Good |
| C3 | Good |
| D1 | Satisfactory |
| D2 | Satisfactory |
| D3 | Adequate |
| PASS |
| FAIL |
| E1 | Inadequate/Fail |
| E2 | Inadequate/Fail |
| F | Serious fail |
| NS | Non-submission/Non-appearance |


## Plagiarism and academic misconduct

:::note
This suggested section is not in the current handbook template.
:::

Academic misconduct includes cheating, collusion, and plagiarism. Essentially, all work submitted for assessment should be yours except in cases where group work is a specific requirement of an assignment.

Plagiarism and other forms of academic misconduct are serious disciplinary matters that will incur a £125 financial penalty. Further strictures may include:

- having to resit an assessment
- having to resit the module
- having to retake a year of study
- having to leave the Conservatoire

Further information, including the mechanism for appeal, may be found in the Conservatoire's [Regulations, Codes of Procedure and General Rules](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/qualityassurance/rules-and-regulations/)

## Non-submission

:::note
This section is not in the current handbook: maybe not needed, covered by the Rules & Regs?
:::

Resits due to non-submission or non-attendance shall be subject to a fee of £125 per component per resit within a module. Resits due to cheating or plagiarism shall also be subject to a fee of £125 per component per resit within a module.

## Graduation costs

:::note
This section is not in the current handbook template, but we were asked to put it in the handbooks last year.
:::

There is no fee to graduate and attend the Graduation Ceremony. However, there is a fee to hire a gown which is compulsory. A fee of approximately £50 is payable to an external gown supplier and you will be advised of how to do this as part of the graduation registration process.
