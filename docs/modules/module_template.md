# Title of the Module

## Overview
:::note
Section 1 starts here.
:::

:::note
Dependent upon the context, this section may be used to articulate the relationship to programme aims, rationale for module, and/or the ways in which the module relates to other modules/strands/pathways. Use student-facing language ('In this module you will…').
:::

:::note
The 'Programme summary details' and 'Learning modes' have been placed at the bottom of the page to give a more student-facing narrative to the module descriptor.
:::


## Learning outcomes

On successful completion of this module you will be able to:

* **LO1** Articulate…
* **LO2** Demonstrate…
* **LO2** etc…

## Assessment

### Assessment 1

:::note
In student-facing language, state type of assessment (eg performance, reflective statement).

Scope should indicate requirement of submission (eg length of performance or word count) and any other requirements such as format. Where the scope of the assessment is variable according to context (eg SoM disciplines/departments), reference may be made to a supplementary information elsewhere in the programme handbook.

Weighting should be in denominations of 10% and add up to 100% or state Pass/Fail. Any assessment component which is pass/fail within a graded module should not have percentage weighting attached.

State what LOs are addressed by each assessment.

## Delivery

:::note
Section 2 starts here. Original heading was 'Delivery and assessment' which is confusing given that 'Assessment' is also dealt with in part 1? Have retained 'Assessment outline' below.
:::

### Module coordinator

Name name

### Module schedule 2025-26

:::note
Guidance: use this section to introduce the overall shape of the module, topics covered, activites and independent study. You can give a descriptive overview or a tight schedule as best fits the module of study.

### Feedback methods

### Assessment criteria

#### Assessment 1
:::note
Normally a maximum of four criteria
:::
Assessors will look for:

* criterion
* criterion
* criterion

### Rubric

:::warning
Question: the current handbook template suggests that A1 and A2 be described as 'Outstanding'. That does not correspond to the Common Assessment Scale, where A1-5 are all 'Excellent'. Is this ok? Should the Common Assessment Scale be modified? Or is this mismatch in the rubrics ok?
:::

|Assessment 1 criteria|criterion|criterion|criterion|
|---|---|---|---|
|A1-2 Outstanding work at this level||||
|A3-5 Excellent||||
|B1-3 Very good||||
|C1-3 Good||||
|D1-3 Satisfactory||||
|E1-2 Inadequate/fail||||

:::note
Comment: as we are currently highlighting Word documents as a way of using rubrics in practice, this is a case where it might actually be simpler to author the rubric in Word and give a link to a .pdf here in the handbook: [Example rubric](/example_rubric.pdf)
:::


## Resources

### Essential
### Recommended

:::note
If the distinction between 'essential' and 'recommended' is moot, then delete subheadings and just use 'Resources'
:::

## Other information

:::note
If there is no 'other information' then delete this heading
