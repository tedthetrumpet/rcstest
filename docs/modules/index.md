# Modules

:::note
This page is currently just a link to a list of modules. However, it could be used as some general explanatory information? A glossary? What does 'formative' mean? What are 'SCQF levels?'.
:::

:::note
This page could also make explicit which parts of a module descriptor ('Section 1') need a formal modification process, and which ('Section 2') may be changed year on year, rather than clutter the module descriptors themselves with that information.
