Original in its synthesis and an identifiable contribution to scholarship in the field  |
| Very Good: B1-3 | Technically skilful, very expressive, well focused, detailed, articulate, effective and imaginative | Creative, original, and intelligent work, securely rooted in practice and theory | Active, co-operative, sustained contribution to the ensemble, project or class; openness in collaboration with other disciplines | A deep understanding of the research area with evidence of originality in a clearly focussed argument, supported by detailed reference to appropriate scholarship |
