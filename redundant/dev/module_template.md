:::note
The module overview goes here. Dependent upon the context, this section may be used to articulate the relationship to programme aims, rationale for module, and/or the ways in which the module relates to other modules/strands/pathways. Use student-facing language ('In this module you will…').

## Learning modes

:::note
Guidance: the table below indicats the way in which the learning is disseminated, eg Lecture; Class; Seminar; Group of 6-8; Webinar.  Include independent study. Ensure the overall hours add up correctly to the total notional effort.

| Learning modes | Indicative total (hours) |
| ---------|----------|
| [Type of learning] | [hours] |
| [Type of learning] | [hours] |
| Total notional student effort| [hours] |

## Learning outcomes

On successful completion of this module you will be able to:

* **LO1** Articulate…
* **LO2** Demonstrate…
* **LO2** etc…

## Assessment

### Assessment 1, [Type, scope and weighting]

[In student-facing language, state type of assessment (eg performance, reflective statement).]

[Scope should indicate requirement of submission (eg length of performance or word count) and any other requirements such as format. (Where the scope of the assessment is variable according to context (eg SoM disciplines/departments), reference may be made to a supplementary information elsewhere in the programme handbook.)]

[Weighting should be in denominations of 10% and add up to 100% or state Pass/Fail. Any assessment component which is pass/fail within a graded module should NOT have percentage weighting attached.]

[State what LOs are addressed by each assessment.]

#### Assessment 1 criteria

Assessors will look for:

* criterion… (LO1)
* criterion… (LO1, L02)
* etc

[Any other information about assessment]

#### Assessment criteria [alternative approach]

[Alternatively, assessment criteria may be stated by Learning Outcome, rather than by asessment:]

Assessors will look for:

**LO1** Articulate…
* criterion
* criterion

**LO2** Demonstrate…
* criterion
* criterion


### Feedback

[Where appropriate, clarify the relationship between formative and summative feedback, and/or indicate how feedback will be given.]

## Resources

### Essential
### Recommended

[If the distinction between 'essential' and 'recommended' is moot, then delete subheadings and just use 'Resources']

## Other information

[If there is no 'other information' then delete this heading]
