# Supporting Studies 1 (30 Credits)

This module will give you the opportunity to take part in a range of negotiated activities in support both of your Principal Study and of your development as an emerging professional.

The emphasis is on working collaboratively in a widening circle of peers, potentially encompassing: your colleagues within your own discipline; other musicians within the School of Music; fellow students from the Undergraduate and Research cohorts; staff and students from other Schools within the Conservatoire; and professionals from a range of disciplines.

The module incorporates a series of cohort-wide graduate seminars, addressing such areas as research skills, critical thinking, professional development, reflective practice, health and wellbeing, and equality and diversity.

## Learning outcomes

On successful completion of this module you will be able to:

* **LO1** Demonstrate professional attitudes and the ability to engage effectively with professionals and peers
* **LO2** In a number of contexts, demonstrate ownership of the design and shape of your studies
* **LO3** Show technical and expressive mastery within supporting studies activities

## Assessment

#### Assessment 1: Observation of Working Practice 100% – Pass/Fail

Feedback relating to supporting studies activities will be given to students along with indicative grades, which will be recorded on the Student Contract. Prior to the exam board, the indicative grades – and, where necessary, the feedback itself – will be scrutinised by an internal examination board chaired by the Director of Music, leading to an overall module result of Pass or Fail.

Assessed LOs: 1, 2, 3.

### Assessment criteria
Assessors will look for:

LO1 – Demonstrate professional attitudes and the ability to engage effectively with professionals and peers
* active and generous collaboration with professionals and peers
* openness and sensitivity
* an ability to assimilate advice and criticism
* maintenance of a professional standard of attendance and timekeeping

LO2 – In a number of contexts, demonstrate ownership of the design and shape of your studies
