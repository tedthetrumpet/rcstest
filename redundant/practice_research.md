# Practice Research

In this module you will be exposed to research methodologies that have as their starting point the process of making music. You will select an aspect of your musical work to serve as the focus for the module, and produce a short proposal outlining both your research questions and the approach you wish to take in exploring them. Over the course of your studies, with the support of a supervisor, you will assemble a portfolio of documentation and reflective writing that interrogates a self-chosen research focus and communicates your findings.

## Learning outcomes

On successful completion of this module you will be able to:

* **LO1** Articulate a critical stance with respect to a documented aspect of your practice
* **LO2** Demonstrate a range of skills associated with deepening your practice, including communication, research, reflection and scholarship

## Assessment

#### Assessment 1: Portfolio 100% Pass/Fail

Assessed LOs: 1, 2

### Assessment criteria
Assessors will look for:

* clarity and depth of critical thinking
* a scholarly approach to reflection and documentation
* effective communication

The final submission will in many cases include audiovisual material in addition to writing: for this reason, no definitive word count can be given. As an indication, the written part of the project should not normally exceed 3000 words.

### Feedback

You will be given verbal feedback on your initial research proposal, and written feedback from an assessor on your final portfolio submission.
