# Principal Study Performance 1

The Principal Study is focussed primarily on your individual development as a musician. The central plank of learning and teaching in this module is the one-to-one lesson with an expert tutor. These lessons will form part of an ongoing cycle of individual practice and reflection, and will require you to devote a substantial amount of time to independent learning. Alongside this individual activity, there will in many departments be time allocated to taught and/or supervised group activity. This includes, for example; the participation of instrumentalists in large ensemble activities; the work of singers and instrumentalists in opera productions; and chamber music and small ensemble coaching.

## Learning outcomes

On successful completion of this module you will be able to:

* **LO1** Demonstrate technical and expressive mastery in your principal study
